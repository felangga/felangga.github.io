# 28 April 2023 
I found a nice and complete collection of Macintosh Classic II. It included the Mac itself, keyboard, mouse and an external 800k drive. Someone sells this thing on Instagram, and then I contacted the seller to ask about its condition. He said that it was first hand from his uncle and last January 2023 it was tested okay and running. But currently, he didn't have the power cord to test it. 
So I decided to do gambling to buy this old machine, I hope that the internal battery is not leaked or better it has already been removed.

It was manufactured on October 1991, which is before I was born ðŸ¤£

After dealing with the price and shipping charges, it then shipped with cargo to Yogyakarta from Bandung. My concerns were the internal battery and the CRT. I hope the CRT is not broken by the shipping. He said that he added more plastic wrap to protect the CRT.
