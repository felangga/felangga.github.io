title: "Macintosh Classic II Restoration"

# 28 April 2023 
I found a nice and complete collection of Macintosh Classic II. It included the Mac itself, keyboard, mouse and an external 800k drive. Someone sells this thing on Instagram, and then I contacted the seller to ask about its condition. He said that it was first hand from his uncle and last January 2023 it was tested okay and running. But currently, he didn't have the power cord to test it. 
So I decided to do gambling to buy this old machine, I hope that the internal battery is not leaked or better it has already been removed.

It was manufactured on October 1991, which is before I was born ü§£

After dealing with the price and shipping charges, it then shipped with cargo to Yogyakarta from Bandung. My concerns were the internal battery and the CRT. I hope the CRT is not broken by the shipping. He said that he added more plastic wrap to protect the CRT.

At noon around 1 PM, I was contacted by the cargo courier that they will send a package to my home, and they need me to stand by. Fortunately, I am working at home. 
So the package came and the wood package was already removed by the courier (I don't know why they do this without confirming with me first). Everything was complete and arrived safely without any crack on the CRT. Except for the keyboard cable to the computer üò¢ 

The cable is so rare because it's not a PS/2 cable but a cable with (Apple Desktop Bus) ADB connector. On eBay, it's around Rp. 200K to 500K. 
So I asked the seller about the cable, and fortunately, the cable was not missing but he forgot to include it with the package.

So he sent the cable without asking for shipping cost üòÄ

## Tearing down

Okay, then I checked and opened the machine hoping that no battery leakage on the logic board. I opened the case but there are missing screws on the top section of the case. There should be four back screws for the Macintosh design, 2 on top of the case and 2 on the bottom case.

CRT was okay, with no crack and still vacuum tube was still sealed. One thing that makes me happy is that the battery has already been removed from this machine üëè although it was very dirty with some dead animals.

As I expected, the SMD capacitors are leaky, and they leak into many components around them. Some of the leaky electrolytes go under microchips, which are difficult to clean, except by removing the components and cleaning them or using an ultrasonic cleaner. 

`Btw this board included 2 SIMM RAMs which were 4 MB each. So the internal memory total is around 10 MB`
