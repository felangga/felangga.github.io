I got this beautiful old keyboard from my friend, it is an Apple mechanical keyboard from 1986. Why do I love this keyboard? because it's mechanical, and I believe that a mechanical keyboard has a longer age than a membrane keyboard. The keycaps mostly use PBT plastic, but the plastic cover case and the space button are made with ABS plastic so it is yellowing over time. So I decided to restore the plastic using an H2O2 solution.

## Use the 12% H2O2 solution

## After result
I got no photos when the keyboard is under the sun, so here is the result after a couple of hours under the sun.

Maybe it can be more white, but the current weather is cloudy and not very good for retrobrighting, maybe I need a UV light to do indoor retrobrighting.
