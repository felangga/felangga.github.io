title: "Fiberhome HG6145D2 Superadmin Login"
--- 

Maybe some of you are using In**ehome ISP as your home internet and found out that using the provided login has minimal options to configure the router:
```
user
user1234
```

I know it's not the admin login, and that must be a full-control user account that can be used to control this router fully. So I searched and found some posts 
on the net and most of them are telling me to use:
```
admin
%0|F?H@f!berhO3e
```
I tested it and it doesn't work!

But there's more to it, you need to reset the router first by pressing the reset button on the side of the router. 
Then after resetting, you can log in using the admin superaccount!
But keep in mind, never to use the `user` login again, because it will lock the super admin login until you reset the router again. 

Cheers 🍺
